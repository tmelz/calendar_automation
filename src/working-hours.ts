/**
   * TODO high level plan for defrag
   *
   * need to know constraints
   * - what meetings need to move / can move
   *   - OOO meetings
   *   - conflicted meetings
   *   - o/w all 1:1s
   * - what optional meeting destinations there are (from my cal and theirs)
   *   - âœ… thus need to know working hours
   * - if a meeting is a recurring meeting, need to know cadence so i can understand how much it can move
   *   - eg weekly 1:1s should only move +/- 1 day; ðŸ‘Œ I can just use presence of "recurringEventId" as a rough first pass.
   *          for more thorough i could fetch the actual event and then parse the recurrenc rule:
   *            "recurrence": ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=FR"],
   *          not super important to get this precise. wondering if there's some way to improve this so it isn't so manual
   *          to get the details but that's OK for now. it limits some options but probably not by too much.
   *          practically speaking being able to shift by +/- 1 day is decent, for biweekly i'd allow like +/-2 i guess
   *
   * need to supply scoring function
   * - negative points
   *  - [day] if longer than 2hrs of meetings
   *  - [day] if gap between meetings
   *  - [week] if meetings are not balanced across days
   * - positive points
   *  - [day] more focus time
   * 
   * 
   * === rough simulated annealing approach
   * 
   * need some repr of overall schedule
   * need list of meetings to place
   * for each meeting, need list of what potential openings it can be placed in
   *  or including their availability and mine
   * need some easy way to compute cost func
   *  in future: incl their cost func as well
   * need some easy way to compute "neighbors"
   * 
   * do i need to do a compact framing of the problem? or can i just use the objs
   * 
   * 24 hours * 2 slots per hour * 7 days = 336 potential meeting slots
   *  this is a pretty verbose framing... hm not terrible i guess but not great
   * mapping meeting to desired timeslot is pretty easy, just {id: number} map
   * maybe mapping to availability is as simple as {id: set(number)}
   *  but how to easy update when i move something; 
   *  i guess just 
   *  foreach moveableMeeting id; do prune takenTimeslot from  availability[id]
   *  but if you want to go _backwards_ here, that's no good
   * so you need 
   *    originalAvailabilities {meeting id: set(number)}
   *    currentAvailabilities  {meeting id: set(number)}
   * if i move meeting x from time a-->b
   *    for all moveablemeetings
   *      if a in originalAvailabilities[id]
   *        currentAvailabilities[id].add(a)
   * ugh that's pretty messy, every time you make a change you iter over all meetings
   * not totally terrible but very inefficient
   * what would make that faster.
   * could just keep track of 
   *  newlyTakenTimeslots: set(number)
   * and use originalAvailabilities when picking nieghbors, but keep selecting randomly
   *  when you check if taken?
   * that works but if a meeting has no actual avails you infinite loop...
   * so i think you need multiple maps?
   * 
   *  [nope dont need] originalAvailabilities {meeting id: set(number)}
   *  currentAvailabilities  {meeting id: set(number)}
   *  timeslotToMeetingOriginalAvailability     {number: set(meeting id)}
   *  moveableMeetings set(meeting id)
   * 
   * so now if you move meeting x from time a --> b
   *    since a freed up you do; timeslotToMeetingOriginalAvailability[a].foreach
   *      currentAvail[id].add(a)
   *    also
   *    timeslotToMeetingOriginalAvailability[b].foreach
   *      currentAvail[id].remove(b)
   * 
   * now to choose next neighbor
   *  random (moveable) meeting id
   *    random currentAvail[id] choice
   * 
   * ok so i dont think you actually need original availabilities map, you just need the second two
   * 
   * ok that's reasonably compact; 336 potential meeting slots but when i restrict to my actual avail it should
   * shrink a ton, basically 9 hours * 2 slots * 5 days = probably 90 numbers
   * probably only 15 meetings to consider in a week so overhead isnt a huge deal
   * 
   * ok how to do scoring with this repr
   * i guess i also need {number: meeting id}
   * hm that stops working well when i htink about 1hr 1:1s hm
   * the general idea is you could just iterate over keys in sorted order
   * could easily get a sense of gaps
   * how to measure meetings per day? just segment out numbers i suppose
   * 
   * something like assignedTimeslots {number: meeting id}
   * 
   * do i need to keep track of meetings not assigned yet?
   * or will every meeting have a assignment to start
   * i think thats mostly feasible but i think in some cases it wont be
   * 
   * ok how to do scoring
   * if i just had meeting[] in sorted starttime order wouldnt be too bad
   * easy to detect gaps
   * reasonable to get meeting load per day
   * semi difficult to get focus time
   * 
   * maybe i could equivalently just do {timeslot : meeting} mapping
   * and have sorted ordering for traversal
