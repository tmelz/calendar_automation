# Features

- ‚è≥ Start all 1:1 meetings at 5 minutes past the hour automatically; this is the best setting for frequent meetings.
- üö® Automatically detect if someone is OOO for 1:1s, even if they RSVP'd yes. Flagged in the meeting title. Takes into account all day OOO and specific time range OOO (e.g. 1-2pm).
- ‚öîÔ∏è Detects when someone has RSVPd to another event at the same time as a 1:1, and flags in the meeting title. Avoids last minute "I'm double booked" DMs!
- üëª Detect if someone in a 1:1 is no longer an employee
- üîÅ Runs automatically, daily and whenever your calendar changes

# Warning

This tool automatically modifies your calendar. That comes with certain risks. I've taken many precautions to mitigate the risk, but please be aware that this is not a bulletproof tool and there's a chance it could mess up some of your calendar. Mitigations are listed below:

- üõ°Ô∏è Unit tests run against real world data from my calendar
- üõë The tool only operates on the meetings occurring this week and the next complete week. Meaning that it will never modify meetings further than 2 weeks out.
- üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è There's a hard cap on the number of meetings it can modify in one run (30), to prevent any kind of runaway issue.

# Dry run

1. After `clasp push`, open `install.gs` in the Apps script IDE and run `runDailyChecksDryRun()`
2. OR deploy the webapp and open it, there will be an interactive way to dry run
